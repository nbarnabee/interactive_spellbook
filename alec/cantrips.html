      <p>You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within
        5
        feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in
        booming
        energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target
        takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.</p>
      <p>This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8
        thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage
        rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).</p>

      <p>You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds
        bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.
        Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or
        dismiss it as an action.</p>
      <p>If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving
        throw to avoid the spell.</p>

      <p>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a
        broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any
        dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.</p>
      <p>This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an
        object.

      <p>This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following
        magical effects within range:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint
          musical notes, or an odd odor.</li>
        <li>You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>
        <li>You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.</li>
        <li>You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end
          of
          your next turn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a
        time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>
