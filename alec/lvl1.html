      <p>You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with
        advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until
        the
        spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a
        friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.</p>
      <p>
      <h3>At Higher Levels.</h3> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one
      additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you
      target them.</p>

      <p>For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand
        any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes
        about 1 minute to read one page of text.</p>
      <p>This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a
        written language.</p>

      <p>For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you
        can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and
        you learn its school of magic, if any.</p>
      <p>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin
        sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>

      <p>You make yourself--including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person--look different
        until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can
        appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same
        basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p>
      <p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to
        add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would
        feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches
        out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p>
      <p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on
        an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p>

      <p>Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per
        round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land
        on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.</p>

      <p>You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some
        other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use,
        and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If
        the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.</p>
      <p>If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting
        it.</p>

      <p>You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the
        spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or
        if you dismiss the spell as an action.</p>

        within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can
        direct them to hit one creature or several.</p>
